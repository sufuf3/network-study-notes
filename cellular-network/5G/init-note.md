## 前言
紀錄從 https://www.tutorialspoint.com/5g/index.htm 這邊學習整理出來的。

## 5G 的功能

1. 100 times more devices
2. Faster response time
3. Very high capacity
4. More software option to upgrade
5. Ubiquitios connectivity
6. Wide range of applications
7. Speed up to 10 Gbit/s
8. Virtually '0' latency

## 5G 技術

- High increased peak bit rate
- Larger data volume per unit area (i.e. high system spectral efficiency)
- High capacity to allow more devices connectivity concurrently and instantaneously
- Lower battery consumption
- Better connectivity irrespective of the geographic region, in which you are
- Larger number of supporting devices
- Lower cost of infrastructural development
- Higher reliability of the communications
